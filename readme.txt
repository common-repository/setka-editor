== Discover a faster way to design beautiful performance-based content ==

Setka empowers everyone to easily design content that converts. It puts creativity and efficiency into the hands of editors and designers, while also being seamlessly integrated and scalable technology.

Setka design tool is part of the world’s most trusted content authoring and designing toolbox.

Right now, there are tens of thousands of market-leading applications [powered by Tiny](https://tiny.cloud/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_campaign=setka_integration), globally.

== Get the best out of Gutenberg ==

As a no-code design tool, Setka perfectly complements the Gutenberg editor. In fact, it was among the first plugins ready for the release of WordPress 5.0. And Setka’s been developed as a separate content block, so it’s easily used with any other blocks on your page.

This means you can get the flexibility you need when designing eBooks, landing pages, or special campaigns while also saving time with your reusable Gutenberg blocks. You get the best of both worlds.

== Customize design without coding ==

* Your content creation process is totally transformed when you use Setka. You can arrange text, insert images, and place other visual elements into beautiful layouts — without having to know or use any code.

* Our personalized, brand style packs and reusable templates ensure your content carries a consistent look and feel on every published page. This delivers better brand recall and awareness amongst your readers — all in a couple of clicks.

* This means more beautiful pages with less stress, and it leaves more time for your developers to focus on their important tasks.

>“Setka puts power directly into the hands of editors and designers to create stunning content with beautiful features — without much extra effort (and without always having to rely on developers).”

>“Setka Editor makes it easy for brands and publishers to build interactive, beautiful, and fast-loading content without having to code at all. After integrating with AMP for WordPress, their client’s AMP version looks identical, but loads so much faster — not only on mobile [5 seconds faster], but also on desktop [6.3 seconds faster]”.

== Seamless production process ==

Setka makes designing easier and doesn’t get in your way when you’re doing it. That’s why our tool works within your editorial and technical processes, by providing:

* **Responsive previews:** When designing an article you see exactly how it looks when published. Press tab to instantly preview both desktop and mobile versions.
* **Team collaboration and rights management:** Everything’s built in — so you can work effectively as a team. Add multiple users to your post, set user rights, and easily communicate and collaborate through comments.
* **Extra customization through code:** If you want, you can also add custom CSS and alter HTML within the post, or any of your reusable design elements.

== Improve performance and build mobile-ready content ==

Stop losing your audience due to poor page performance. Setka automatically creates SEO-friendly and mobile-optimized posts.

* **Proper code structure** and other optimizations inbuilt, that get you faster load times and higher LightHouse scores. Unlike many post-builders, Setka works within your post content and allows for a lower level of nesting (which means faster loading times). It uses header tags correctly and supports the input of alt text for all your images, as well as being compatible with Yoast and other WordPress SEO plugins.
* **Automatic responsive layout** optimized for mobile.
* **Instant preview** for web and mobile.

>“Since working with Setka Editor, we’ve seen our bounce rate go down by 84%, a 14% increase in homepage traffic, and average session duration up by 127%. The tool helps us structure the information on our blog and enhance it with photos, videos, GIFs, and more while pre-configured fonts, header styles, and pull-quotes save us time on creating posts and ensure we maintain a singular style”.

== Beautiful content, even if you uninstall ==

As part of our mission to democratize content creation, we don’t want to lock you into our platform (although we hope you’ll stay!).

Everything is saved as HTML code in your database, and CSS files can be stored either on your side or delivered from the Setka CDN.

Improved compatibility with AMP WP plugin in ‘Paired’ mode.

= 1.16.0 - August 6, 2018 =

Now, we have integrated Setka Editor plugin with the AMP WP plugin. When installed on the same website they automatically increase the loading speed for mobile pages while retaining stylistic and branding elements.

We make it work with all three modes in the AMP WP plugin:

— ‘Classic’ offers a ready-made template for the theme and allows the Google bot to index the pages of the site as soon as the plugin is installed.;
— ‘Paired’ assumes that the owner of the website or the creator of the theme has created separate templates for AMP and other versions of the website.;
— ‘Native’ is seamless integration, where the website is created specifically for AMP, and there is no need to create separate links, templates, and so on.

We wrote four sanitizers for elements that weren’t compatible with AMP notations and created smaller files for styling elements that are in line with the design demands.

1. The animation sanitizer converts Setka Editor animations into AMP animations, while keeping any interactive features like activation on a specific user action or movement of elements.
2. The embed element sanitizer transform a responsive embed into relevant AMP elements and correctly integrates them into the page.
3. The gallery sanitizer transforms the component for displaying a series of images into the relevant AMP element.
4. The image sanitizer displays the srcset attribute with all available resolutions, allowing the browser to decide which size is best for the user. This makes loading images faster and allows content to adapt to a device’s screen size.

So that clients can set up themes for displaying content, Setka created the Style manager.
